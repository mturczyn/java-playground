# java-playground
To learn Java, keep useful notes and examples from various articles and courses.

To prototype and learn quickly I started creating Java projects, This repo is started with 3 base projects used to prototype and explore Java world:
- `java-pilot` - simple console app, built with Maven, added Hibernate to try some ORM, presents simple operations,
- `java-gradle-pilot` - Java project with Gradle as build system, to check out Gradle itself, pure console app printing only greeting in console,
- `springboot-gradle-pilot` - Java project with Gradle, to try out building web APIs in Java, project built with Springboot as web framework with Hibernate as ORM (to communicate with database).
